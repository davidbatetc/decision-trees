# Decision Trees
The following document describes the approach followed to solve the problem presented in [*Decision Trees*](https://gebakx.github.io/hs-dts/), a Haskell programming project of the course *Programming Languages* (Fall semester, 2020), which is part of the course offer of the *Facultat d'InformÃ tica de Barcelona* (FIB - UPC).


## Short description
We are tasked with creating a Haskell program that allows us to build a **decision tree** from a data set and then classify examples that are *not* part of the data set via user interaction. In particular, the program must be able to process the data set [*Mushroom*](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom), of the *UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository*. A broader description of the problem, along with the requirements of the assignment, can be found [**here**](https://gebakx.github.io/hs-dts/).


## Construction of the decision tree
The decision tree in this program is implemented using as a guideline the description in [[1] Gerard Escudero, 2020, *Machine Learning* (pages 35 to 40)](https://gebakx.github.io/ml/#35).

### Definition of the decision tree
Following Haskell's philosophy, the decision tree is defined *in a generalized way*, as follows.

```haskell
data DT a b = Leaf a | Node String [(b, DT a b)]
```

As a consequence, both the classes and the values can be of any given type. Note that this is a recursive definition. A decision tree can either be a **leaf**, or a **node** whose children are decision trees which are accessed via values of an attribute. Hence, it is possible to define, for example,

```haskell
dt = Node "Attribute 1" [(100, Node "Attribute 2" [(55, Leaf 67.54)])]
```

### Feeding data to the decision tree generator
In order to build a decision tree, we need to know which **attributes** we will consider, as well as the **values** of these attributes for different examples. Using the mushrooms as an analogy, the following data type is defined.

```haskell
data Specimen a b = Specimen a [b]
```

The purpose of this definition is to encapsulate the concept of *example to be feeded to the decision tree*, in an attempt to make the code easier to read. Once again, this definition is given in a generalized way. We can then generate a decision tree in the following way.

```haskell
sps = [Specimen "edible" ["convex", "brown"], Specimen "poisonous" ["bell", "brown"]]
attrs = ["cap-shape", "cap-color"]
dt = generateDT attrs sps
```

Note that the types of the classes and the values of the attributes of the specimens need to be instances of the `Ord` class for this implementation of the construction of the decision tree. It would be possible, however, to implement it so that they only need to be instances of the `Eq` class.  


### Short note on efficiency
One of the most critical parts of building the decision tree in terms of efficiency is **measuring the accuracy** of each of the attributes in order to decide which is the best one at a given point. In this implementation, this is by done using an algorithm the relies heavily on sorting and grouping repetitions. Since this is the part of the algorithm that has the highest time complexity, it is important to optimize it as much as possible. For this reason, this program includes a **modified merge sort** that sorts a list of elements while counting repetitions. Let us provide a couple of examples:

```haskell
>>>> mgsortBy compare [1, -1, 2, 1, 4, 5, -1, 5, 4, 2, 3]
[(2,-1),(2,1),(2,2),(1,3),(2,4),(2,5)]
>>>> mgsortBy (flip compare) ["brown", "yellow", "brown", "brown", "yellow", "pink"]
[(2,"yellow"),(1,"pink"),(3,"brown")]
```


### Heuristics


## Classification


## Usage
There are mainly two ways to run this program. The first option is to **compile the program** and then run the compiled file. The second option is to run the program using an **interactive environment**. The [*Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)*](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) is recommended for both options. The following instructions have been tested in a Linux environment, and they might differ slightly in other operating systems.

### Compiled version
In order to run the program we first have to compile it. This can be achieved by running the following command in a terminal once *ghc* has been installed.
```bash
$ ghc dts.hs
```
It is possible to compile the program using different options, which can be found running
```bash
$ ghc --help
```
Once the program has been compiled it can be run using
```bash
$ ./dts
```

### Interactive environment
In order to run the program in the interactive environment of *ghc* we can use the command.
```bash
$ ghci dts.hs
```
